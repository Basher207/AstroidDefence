# Week 7
During this week, we discussed how we would make the enemies destroyable, and so we implemented a simple health system to their script. To make the enemies' health more noticeable to the player, we came up with a color indication system. When an enemy is hit by a turret shot, its color would slowly change to a strong shade of red, representing a decrease in its life, until it reaches zero, when the enemy would finally be destroyed.

The other important thing that was done during this week was the addition of a new type of turret, the Ion Cannon. 
The Ion Cannon is a weapon that has an Area of Effect type of attack, which means that the damage is does when it fires on a single tile gets spread out to adjacent tiles. But with this destructive power comes the disadvantage of this kind of turret, as its range is quite limited, being only able to shoot upwards and change its shooting angle very slightly, as opposed to the default turret that can shoot at enemies at closes ranges. This turret was implemented with the idea of diversifying the game's flow, adding a layer of strategy to it by making the player have to decide what kind of turret would be best suited for each stage, and where each turret should be positioned so as to take the best out of each turret's features and limitations.
