During this week, we discussed the functionality of the turrets and enemies, and came up with some ideas.
Our biggest idea is the main ship's change of shape to that of a torus. This gives our game an interesting shift in strategy, because it breaks the normal functionality of the turrets: while in normal tower defence games the turrets can only shoot at their surrounding areas, giving the ship a torus shape allows for a third dimension of attack, expanding the possibilities for turret placement strategy.
Another important thing that was discussed was the navigation system, which calculates the path that the enemies have to take while on top of the ship's hull to get to the ship's reactor. This path gets updated every time a new turret is placed, and it doesn't allow the player to block the path with turrets, making for a harder and more strategic gameplay.
